* The name of the file should be ReadMe.txt instead of Readme.txt.

* Well-documented comprehensive Startup.java. Good.

* Good documentation. But Typically javadoc of a method includes the description of the method at the top and the specs of param, return, etc. follows the description. You just did the other way. Please see a change I made in your SiinglyLinkedList.java file

* All tests pass. Very Good.

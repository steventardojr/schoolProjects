Homework 2

Homework 2 is made up of 2 classes: SinglyLinkedList and Startup. SinglyLinkedList is an implementation of a singly linked list, that is, it is a list that contains nodes, which are made up of a generic data type and a pointer to the next node. Each node is only aware of the next node in the list; nothing is known about the previous node. The implementation of nodes can be found in the inner class Node in SinglyLinkedList. SinglyLinkedList implements Iterable. This allows the list to be traversed by an instance of the Iterator class. The Iterator class that implements Iterator can also be found as an inner class of SinglyLinkedList. The class Startup contains the main method and shows the functionality of SinglyLinkedList. Further implementation documentation can be found in the comments of the source code of each of the classes.

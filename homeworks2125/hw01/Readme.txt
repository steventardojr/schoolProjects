Homework 1

Homework 1 is made up of 3 classes: MyArrayList, Startup, and TestMyArrayList. MyArrayList is an implementation of the Java class ArrayList with methods to add and remove generic items, check the size of the ArrayList, and place its contents in a String. Startup contains the main method and shows the functionality of the MyArrayList class. TestMyArrayList is a JUnit test class that checks the functionality of each of the methods in the MyArrayList class: add(), remove(), size(), and toString(). The Startup class shows that the functionality of the MyArrayList class is correct, and the TestMyArrayList class shows that each method in the MyArrayList class performs as it should. The source code contains comments for more in-depth information about the functionality of each method.
